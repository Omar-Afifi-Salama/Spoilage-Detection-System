    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div class="faq-container">

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is your food spoilage detection system?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our system uses an IoT (Internet of Things) network of sensors to monitor various environmental factors that contribute to food spoilage, such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This data is then analyzed using advanced algorithms to provide real-time insights into the freshness and safety of food products.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What types of food can your system monitor?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our system is designed to be adaptable and can be used to monitor a wide range of food products, including meats, produce, dairy, and packaged goods. The specific sensors and algorithms can be customized to suit the unique spoilage characteristics of different food types.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does the system alert users about spoilage?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">When the system detects potential spoilage based on the sensor data, it sends alerts to users via a mobile app or web dashboard. These alerts provide information about the specific food item, the level of spoilage detected, and recommended actions, such as removing the item from storage or adjusting storage conditions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What are the benefits of using your system?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our system helps reduce food waste by providing early warnings of spoilage, allowing users to take proactive measures. It also improves food safety by preventing the consumption of spoiled food, which can lead to illness. Additionally, it can optimize inventory management and reduce costs for businesses in the food industry.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is the system suitable for home use or just for businesses?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our system is designed to be scalable and can be adapted for both home and business use. We offer different packages and configurations to meet the specific needs of individual consumers and commercial clients.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How is the data collected and protected?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The data is collected by the IoT sensors and transmitted securely to our cloud platform using encrypted communication protocols. We adhere to strict data privacy and security standards to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What kind of sensors does the system use?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our system utilizes a combination of sensors, including temperature and humidity sensors, gas sensors to detect VOCs (volatile organic compounds) released by spoiling food, and potentially other specialized sensors depending on the application.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How is the system installed?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Installation varies depending on the use case. For home use, it might involve placing small sensor units in refrigerators or pantries. For businesses, we offer customized installation services to integrate the system into existing storage facilities or processes.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is the maintenance required for the system?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The system is designed for minimal maintenance. The sensors are typically low-power and long-lasting. Periodic checks and occasional cleaning might be required depending on the environment. We also offer remote monitoring and support services.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What if the system detects a false positive (false alarm)?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our algorithms are designed to minimize false positives. However, in rare cases, environmental factors might trigger an alert. We encourage users to visually inspect the food item and consider other factors before discarding it. We continuously improve our algorithms to reduce the likelihood of false positives.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is the cost of the system?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The cost of the system varies depending on the configuration, the number of sensors required, and any additional services. Please contact us for a customized quote based on your specific needs.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is there a warranty or support offered?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we offer a standard warranty on our hardware components and provide technical support to assist users with any questions or issues they may encounter.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does the system contribute to sustainability?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">By reducing food waste, our system helps conserve valuable resources such as water, energy, and land that are used in food production. This contributes to a more sustainable food system and reduces the environmental impact of food waste.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can the system integrate with other inventory management systems?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we are working on integrations with popular inventory management systems to provide seamless data sharing and enhance overall efficiency for businesses. Please contact us for more information on specific integrations.</div>
